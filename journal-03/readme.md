### Experience
  We all know how Apple's iOS works, it's very **memorable**. This is because of how simple it is, there generally are not too many steps needed to perform a certain action. From the home screen there is just a grid of all your applications and you can reorganize them but they stay in the same structure. On a system like Android, where you can choose whether you want an app on your main home screens, you may have to perform extra steps to get to one that you dont use too much. The iOS approch improves **efficiency** by having everything in the same stucture. iOS also has not changed much over the years since its release, which makes it very **learnable**. So if someone had an iOS device 10 years ago, and they picked one up today they would instantly know how to use it.
  
Some changes I would propose, given the chance, would be to let us choose default applications for email, the browser, and others and also to let us remove unwanted preinstalled apps. This would let a user use apps that they are familiar with and already use. Also the second change would be to help reduce clutter, making things more efficient by reducing the number of apps you would have to look through to find the one that a user would be looking for.
